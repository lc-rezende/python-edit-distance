#### Thanks to [Hiroyuki Tanaka](https://github.com/roy-ht) and his implementation of edit distance (Levenshtein distance) available [here](https://github.com/roy-ht/editdistance).

This library simply implements [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) with C++ and Cython.

The algorithm used in this library is proposed by Heikki Hyyr√∂, "Explaining and extending the bit-parallel approximate string matching algorithm of Myers", (2001)
